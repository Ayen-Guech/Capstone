                  CycleSafe was founded with a clear purpose: to close the knowledge gap faced by women and girls in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Displacement often limits access to resources and reproductive health information, leaving many without the support they need to stay healthy and safe. Through our digital platform and community-led initiatives, CycleSafe provides knowledge, encouragement, and empowerment. Our journey reflects resilience and hope, amplifying voices that are too often unheard and showing that with the right tools, women and girls can thrive even in displacement.
